                    <p>Team Leads will be decided through open group discussion among team members. The goal of this discussion is coordination, not competition.</p>
                    <p>Members are expected to voluntarily align based on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who is most suitable for the task</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>This process reflects how a real professional team works, where leadership emerges from responsibility, not from force, speed, or visibility, and not from racing to take control.</p>
                    <h4 className="font-semibold mt-4">What This Shows About the Team</h4>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Supporting the chosen Team Lead shows a team-first mindset, respect for roles, and focus on outcome, not titles.</li>
                    </ul>
                     <p className="font-semibold text-primary">This is not a leadership race. There is no advantage in pushing for visibility or authority. The true measure of contribution is consistent, high-quality work.</p>

                    <p>If the group cannot reach a decision respectfully, the task owner / core team will assign a Team Lead temporarily. This is done only to move work forward, not to favor anyone.</p>

                    <p>Each project team will have access to one assigned mentor for guidance when required. The mentor’s role is to:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Mentors are not for constant clarification or validation. Teams are expected to:</p>

                        <li>Discuss internally first</li>
                        <li>Attempt solutions collaboratively</li>
                        <li>Reach out to the mentor only when necessary</li>

                    <p>If the team requires help related to process clarification, workflow issues, or platform/coordination support, please contact the Support Team through official channels.</p>
                    <p>Avoid direct, repeated, or individual messages to mentors or founders unless advised. This structure ensures smooth communication, respect for everyone’s time, and a professional working environment.</p>
